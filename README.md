# Restaurant Ordering System
A system where user chooses the food he/she wants from the menu and gets a order token which can be exchanged for food 
at the counter. This system has been employed by many fast food companies like McDonald's and some restaurants too.

This is our attempt at implementing such a system using the spring mvc architecture with Java (backend), jsp + CSS (frontend)
and MongoDB for database.
